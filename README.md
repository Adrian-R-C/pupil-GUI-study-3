# pupil-GUI-study-3

Code and instructions for pre-processing and statistical analysis of evoked pupillary responses used in the research paper **LOCUSTAU**.

The aim of the LocusTau study (Toulouse University Hospital, **NCT07007208**) was to investigate the link between **locus coeruleus markers** (pupillary response, functional and structural integrity), **tau burden** (F18-flortaucipir) and **cognitive performance**, and the **long-term evolution of this relationship**. Pupil data were obtained from the **EyeBrain T2 eyetracker** from Suricog (Paris, France). More informations about the clinical trial : https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07007208

All the code was written on **Matlab**. A graphical interface based on Matlab's AppDesigner is available for those who don't want to go into the code but would like to reproduce the analyses 😉. If you're a Matlab or object-oriented enthusiast, you'll quickly notice that the code isn't optimized... but it works! 😏

For the moment, **the code is only adapted to data from the EyeBrain T2 eyetracker**, and no other device 🙇. However, you are completely free to appropriate and modify the code provided to adapt it to other eyetrackers or rewrite it in another language (GNU GPL-3.0 license).

There are already pupil data analysis scripts and libraries online, but perhaps my contribution can encourage others to improve on my work or even propose a universal matlab pipeline, all accompanied by an easy-to-use interface 😏.
